Contributing to FaceBroke
=========================


## Like the idea of FaceBroke so much you want to help make it better?

Here's the current guidelines for contributing:

1. **Fork**
    - Fork your own copy of the FaceBroke repo

2. **Change**
    - Write your new feature or bugfix on the development branch
    - Test it well

3. **Pull Request**
    - Submit a pull request on the main repo
    - Try to be clear and informative with your title and explain the changes in the body
    - A team lead will review the request and pull it in if it's a fucntional change that adds more fucntionality or fixes the current app. Rewrites (i.e. changing frameworks) would be better discussed as issues first with a GitHub Issue
